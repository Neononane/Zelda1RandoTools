Notes about overall UI & behavior


F5 - place 'start screen' icon at moused tile
F10 - reset timer to 0


DUNGEON ITEM AREA

Click to toggle having triforce (triforce numeral lights up white if location known on overworld map)
Scroll to change item in a dungeon
Left click to mark you have obtained that dungeon item, right click to mark intentionally skipped item. Display is: red box = don't have, green box = do have, purple box = skipped.  
(The purpose of being able to mark items as 'skipped' is so that the various reminder systems will e.g. quit pestering you about the boomerang you left behind on the coast, while 
still accurately capturing your true 'item progress' on the screen for viewers.)

Most item progress has semantic meaning to the tracker with regards to routing/reminders/etc as described below.


OTHER ITEM AREA

coast item, armos item, white sword item - just like dungeon item boxes
4 take-any hearts - click or scroll to say you took a heart container (red heart) or chose another option (X)
wood sword, blue ring, wood arrow, blue candle, magic sword - click these when you get them, so they appear on the Timeline (see below)
bombs - click when you get bombs, to have map routing send you to bombable locations (see below)
boomstick book - click when you get, to mark timeline, and click S/B to toggle whether Shield or Book is available as a dungeon item
ganon/zelda - click when you kill ganon or rescue zelda, to mark the timeline; clicking zelda will also post your finish time as text in the NOTES section
(timer, current hearts - just for display)
OW spots left checkbox - highlight all remaining gettable overworld map tiles

(WPF only)
Audio reminders - toggle all speech synthesis on/off ; recorder/bracelet - toggle just reminders remaining overworld spots requiring those items


OVERWORLD MAP

HFQ/HSQ - if flagsset not known to be 1st/2nd/mixed overworld, select mixed at start, and you Hide First Quest or Hide Second Quest if that's later helpful
Show zones - click or hover to show overworld map zones, as hinted by randomizer NPCs for locations
Show coords - click or hover to show a coordinate overlay
Show N gettable - click to animate all the overworld tiles you could uncover given your current item set

16x8 Map Tiles - scroll to mark what is there:
 - 1-9 dungeons
 - 1-4 any roads (stair warps)
 - S3/S2 magical sword/white sword item cave
 - ??? hint shop
 - (items) item shop
 - heart/potion "take any one you want" cave
 - potions potion shop
 - ?rupee free money or gambling
 - X nothing, or don't care
Left clicking an unmarked map tile will mark it 'X'
Left or right clicking an item shop will cycle through choices of a second item in the shop (max 2 items)
An unclaimed-but-known White Sword Item or Coast Item (as marked in the upper portion of UI) will appear on Sword2 and Coast map tiles, for convenience

Hovering an overworld map tile shows a magnified version of that tile and nearby tiles, to make it easier to see e.g. which square to bomb, without having to squint.

Mouse-hover for routing from the current tile:
 - a path will be drawn from the currently mouse location to all "routeworthy" locations, e.g.
    - unmarked overworld spots
    - uncompleted dungeons
    - un-gotten coast item, white sword item, magical sword
 - "routeworthiness" takes into account your current items (e.g. will not route to burnable tree if have no candle)
 - routing takes into account your current items (e.g. will not cross river if have no ladder)
 - routing understands any-road warps
 - routing assumes recorder takes you to dungeons you already have gotten the triforce from (a common randomizer flag)
 - routing assumes no screen-scrolling or other fancy walk glitches
 - routing knows special map topology (e.g. Lost Hills)
The 12-ish routeworthy spots nearest the mouse cursor will be highlighted greenish if they are guaranteed to yield a location, or yellowish (in mixed quest) if they might be empty.
(WPF only) Right clicking arrow/boomstickbook/bluering/bluecandle/bomb in upper right UI will cause routing to only send you to shops containing that item for the next 10s.

Hovering the 'Hint decoder' in the bottom right pops up the 'Aquamentus Awaits' table.

"Item progress" bar lights up items as you get them or upgrade them, as kind of a quick summary of the player state


TIMELINE

The timeline is an affordance, for e.g. viewers who watch a stream and arrive late, or for the player who finishes a seed and wants a retrospective of their game.
Every minute, the player's inventory (as captured in the top portion of the tracker) is read, and new items are posted to the timeline above the minute-marker.  
This makes it easy to see e.g. that you got the wood sword in the 12th minute.

The timeline is non-interactive, it is just a display capturing progress-over-time.


OPTIONS

Above the timeline, there is a button labeled "Options..."  
Clicking this button causes the timeline pane to be replaced by the options menu.  A variety of features can be turned on and off here.
The options pane automatically closes when the mouse leaves the area, revealing the timeline once again.
Options are saved automatically to a JSON file, so that next time you use the tracker, it remembers your settings.


DUNGEON TRACKER

There are 9 tabs for the 9 dungeons.

Rooms can be scrolled to mark:
 - stairway transports 1-9
 - special room shapes (moats, chutes, tee, chevy, etc)
 - ad-hoc markers (red/yellow/green) the player can use as they see fit
 - grey box (typical 'uncompleted room')
Clicking a room darkens the room (especially the outline), intended to mark it 'complete' (floor drop (if any) has been gotten). Thus uncompleted rooms stand out brighter.
If you click and drag with left mouse button, you can 'paint' a bunch of completed rooms by dragging over them.  Same with right mouse button, but for uncompleted rooms.
Shift-clicking a room will black it out, as well as nearby doors, useful for e.g. Shapes 9 when you have the map, to immediately mark off the 'holes'.

Doors between rooms have three states:
 - dark grey is unknown (default)
 - green (left click) is "can go" (used for all kinds of doors/shutters/bombholes/etc)
 - red (right click) is "cannot go" (e.g. unbombable wall)

Sometimes you may mark up a bit of dungeon map, before noticing that (a portion of) your mapping is offset by a column.  You can click 'GRAB' in the corner of the dungeon map to
switch to 'grab mode', which allows you to pick up entire segments of dungeon rooms and doors and move them at once (cut & paste) to fix an offset map.

FQ and SQ checkboxes will show First Quest or Second Quest outlines for that dungeon number.

Dungeon tracking has no semantic meaning to the tracker, and can be used by the player however they see fit.


NOTES

This area is for ad-hoc textual note-taking by the player (e.g. "2 gohma" to remind you to return to dungeon 2 when you have bow&arrow)


SPEECH SYNTHESIS (WPF only)

There are a variety of spoken reminders triggered based on the player's inventory, map progress, and time.  They are rather ad-hoc, stuff that helped Brian.
You can turn them off with the Audio reminders checkbox in the upper right.


SPEECH RECOGNITION (WPF only)

When hovering over a blank map tile, with a microphone equipped, you can speak e.g. "tracker set bomb shop" to mark the current tile as a bomb shop.

This option must be enabled when first starting the tracker on the start screen, it cannot be enabled later while the application is running.

The list of recognized phrases is below (code from WPFUI.fs).  You can speak a second shop item phrase to set a second item of a shop.

let wakePhrase = "tracker set"
let mapStatePhrases = [|
        "any road"
        "sword three"
        "sword two"
        "hint shop"
        "arrow shop"
        "bomb shop"
        "book shop"
        "candle shop"
        "blue ring shop"
        "meat shop"
        "key shop"
        "shield shop"
        "take any"
        "potion shop"
        "money"
        |]
