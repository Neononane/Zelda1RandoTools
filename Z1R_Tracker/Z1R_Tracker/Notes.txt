Notes about overall UI & behavior


(Some features work only in the Windows version, but not in the Linux version; these are marked 'WPF only'.)


STARTUP OPTIONS

Heart Shuffle: Turning this option off will just cause the first item box of each dungeon to be pre-populated with a heart container.

Hide Dungeon Numbers: (if this is your first time reading this document, skip this section and return to it later)

Enabling this option causes a number of changes in the tracker to help the player deal with this randomizer feature:
 - top area:
   - the dungeon triforces in the top of the tracker will be labeled ABCDEFGH instead of 12345678
   - a button above each triforce can be clicked to select that dungeon's Color and Number, once known
   - clicking the triforce to mark it gotten automatically pops up the Number chooser (and displays the 'triforce decoder diagram')
   - each dungeon has 3 boxes (some will go unused)
   - an additional 'triforce summary' appears in the upper right
      - triforces appear in 1-8 order, this helps the player see the numeric order e.g. when they are trying to recorder-to-next-dungeon 
      - hint 'halo's are associated with triforce numbers (not letters) and thus appear here by default
 - dungeon area:
   - the dungeon tabs are labeled ABCDEFGH9
   - the dungeon tabs and LEVEL- text get the Color of the dungeon
   - LEVEL-N becomes LEVEL-?, and the rainbow question mark is a button to select a Color for the dungeon
 - other:
   - the overworld map tiles for dungeons are labeled A-H
   - the blockers labels are A-H
   - voice reminders may refer to 'this dungeon' rather than e.g. 'dungeon three' when the Number is unknown

The workflow for the player then becomes:
 - when you first encounter a dungeon, label it as the first unused letter A-H: this will always be the canonical label for this dungeon
    - optionally, mark the floor color of the dungeon, by clicking either the '?' in the dungeon tab or the button above that letter's triforce
 - as you get items from the dungeon, mark them in that letter's column
 - when you get the triforce, set the dungeon Number (the Number chooser pops up automatically when you mark the triforce gotten)
 - if you can otherwise deduce with certainty the dungeon Number, set the dungeon number by clicking the button above the triforce

The Color marks are for the player's reference, and have no semantic meaning to the tracker.
The Number marks have semantics that interact with a number of tracker features, you should set it once known.


POPUPS

Z-Tracker uses popups extensively.  Many types of elements (items, map tiles, dungeon rooms, ...) have lots of possible choices to scroll through; 
to better visualize all the options, scrolling the mouse-wheel instantly brings up the popup to see all the choices.  You can either just continue 
scrolling, and then click once you have reached your desired choice, or you can mouse over the grid of choices and click the one you want (mousing 
is often faster when there is a very long list of choices, such as the overworld map tiles).  Clicking outside of a popup will cancel the popup 
and abort making any changes to the element.

When mouse-hovering an element with choices, scroll-wheel always activates the popup.  In certain cases notes below, clicking or double-clicking
may also activate the popup.


DUNGEON ITEM AREA

Triforces:
Click to toggle having triforce.  
Triforce display suggests if dungeon has been located on overworld map: 
 - dark numeral means un-found
 - white numeral means location known
 - highlighted background means have helpful location hint (see below)
Mouse-hovering the triforce will highlight the dungeon's (possible) location(s) on the map if known (or hinted).

Items:
The list of possible items (book, boomerang, ...) appears in a popup.  Choose the item to populate a box, and
 - left click marks it green, to denote that you have this item in your inventory
 - right click marks it red, to denote that you do NOT yet have this item (e.g. you got a helpful hint that the red ring is in 6)
 - middle click marks it purple (with X), to denote you intentionally are skipping this item (see below)
In addition to scrolling, clicking an empty item box will activate the popup.

The purpose of being able to mark items as 'skipped' is so that the various reminder systems will quit pestering you (about, for example, the 
boomerang you intentionally left behind on the coast), while still accurately capturing your true 'item progress' on the screen for viewers.

Most item progress has semantic meaning to the tracker with regards to routing/reminders/etc as described below.


OTHER ITEM AREA

coast item, armos item, white sword item - just like dungeon item boxes
4 take-any hearts - click or scroll to say you took a heart container (red heart) or chose another option (X)
wood sword, blue ring, blue candle, wood arrow, magic sword - click these when you get them, so they appear on the Timeline (see below)
bombs - click when you get bombs, to have map routing send you to bombable locations (see below)
boomstick book - click when you get it to mark the timeline, and click S/B to toggle whether Shield or Book icon is available as a dungeon item
ganon/zelda - click when you kill ganon or rescue zelda, marks timeline; clicking zelda will also post your finish time as text in the NOTES section

(timer, current max hearts - just for display)
'N' gettable - click or hover to highlight all the remaining overworld tiles you could uncover given your current item set; color will be 
  greenish if guaranteed to yield a location, yellowish (mixed quest) if maybe empty.
'N' OW spots left - count of all remaining spots, hovering shows them all with green/yellow highlights as with 'gettable' spots above, and red for 
  un-gettable (given the player's current inventory)
Zones - click or hover to show overworld map zones, as hinted by randomizer NPCs for locations
Coords - click or hover to show a coordinate overlay
HFQ/HSQ - if flagsset not known to be 1st/2nd/mixed overworld, select mixed at start, and Hide First Quest or Hide Second Quest if later helpful

(WPF only) the upper right area of the tracker, containing only the HFQ/HSQ buttons and the timer (and Link) is 'boxed off', so that streamers with
  their own timers can choose to use this 16x9 (4x3) area for a webcam, or a branding image, or whatnot. (Send Brian feedback if you use this.)

Mouse-hovering the white/magical sword icons will highlight their cave's (possible) location(s) on the map if known (or hinted).
Mouse-hovering the boomstick book icon will highlight its shop location on the map, if known.
Mouse-hovering blue_ring/wood_arrow/bomb icon will highlight all its shop locations on the map.
Mouse-hovering blue_candle icon will highlight all its shop locations on the map if you don't yet have a candle, otherwise it highlights burnable trees.
Mouse-hovering the armos icon will highlight any armos locations you have not yet marked up.
Mouse-hovering the power-bracelet/ladder/raft/recorder/redcandle in your inventory or in the 'item progress' bar will 
  highlight any push-block/ladderable/raftable/whistleable/burnable locations you have not yet marked up.


LINK (Specific routing)

Link is here to help guide you on your quest!  Click on Link, select a destination, and the best path(s) from your mouse cursor to the destination
will be shown on the screen for the next ten seconds.

Link can even deal with ambiguous locations, for example, if dungeon 3 was hinted to be 'by a lake', you can have Link route you there, and he will
show routes to all the remaining accessible lake destinations, as well as highlighting other inaccessible locations (e.g. because you don't have 
the raft and can't reach the middle of the lake).  Link's highlight colors are: green for accessible destinations that always have an entrance,
yellow for accessible destinations that only sometimes have an entrance (e.g. mixed quest, some map tiles don't bomb), and red for map tiles of 
interest that you can't reveal with your current inventory.


OVERWORLD MAP

16x8 Map Tiles:

   "icon"       description
   ---------------------------
 - "1-9"        dungeons
 - "1-4"        any roads (stair warps)
 - "sword3/2/1" magical sword/white sword/wood sword item cave
   ---------------------------
 - (items)      item shop
   ---------------------------
 - "green"      secrets: "?" unknown, "$" large, "rupee" medium, "¢" small
 - "door"       door repair charge
 - "dice"       money making game
   ---------------------------
 - "letter"     the potion letter cave
 - "armos"      armos item location (can only be in 5 spots)
 - "purple?"    hint shop, or white/magical sword hint
 - "heart"      cave to "take any one you want"
 - "potion"     potion shop
 - "dark"       nothing, or don't care

The list of all these possible map tile icons appears in a popup.  In addition to scrolling, left-clicking an unmarked map tile will activate the popup.

Right-clicking an unmarked map tile will mark it 'dark', as an accelerator for marking don't-care spots.
Right-clicking an item shop pops up choices for a second item in the shop (max of 2 items).  Left click to change the first item (whole tile popup).
Right-clicking toggles the brightness of some icons; "bright" means somewhere you might return to later; "dark" means you are done with the location.
 - take-any, wood-sword-cave, hint shops, and large/medium/small secrets are all examples of these, where you might walk away and return later

Some map tiles have accelerators.  For example, when selecting the 'take any heart' map tile from the popup grid (or via speech), the take-any
accelerator will pop up, with 4 choices (take potion, take candle, take heart, take nothing).  Your selection may have multiple effects, for 
example, choosing the candle will (1) 'X' out one of the take-any hearts in the top of the tracker, (2) mark that you have a blue candle in the top 
of the tracker, and (3) mark the overworld map tile as a 'taken' take-any-heart.  The accelerator is a pie menu that pops up in the middle of the
window and warps your mouse cursor to the center, so you can quickly make a selection with a small mouse movement and a click.  After making the
selection, your mouse cursor is warped back to the overworld tile you started at.  Using the accelerators is simple and intuitive; reading this
paragraph was comparably more difficult and time-consuming.

An unclaimed White-Sword- or Coast- Item will appear on Sword2 and Coast map tiles, for convenience.
You can interact with these item boxes on their map tiles, rather than having to move your mouse to the top-tracker to interact with them.

Hovering an overworld map tile shows a magnified version of nearby tiles, to make it easier to see e.g. which square to bomb, without having to squint.

Mouse-hover for routing from the current tile: (generalized routing)
 - a path will be drawn from the currently mouse location to all "routeworthy" locations, e.g.
    - unmarked overworld spots
    - uncompleted dungeons
    - un-gotten coast item, white sword item, magical sword
 - "routeworthiness" takes into account your current items (e.g. will not route to burnable tree if you have no candle)
 - routing takes into account your current items (e.g. will not cross river if have no ladder)
 - routing understands any-road warps
 - routing assumes recorder takes you to dungeons you already have gotten the triforce from (a common randomizer flag)
 - routing assumes no screen-scrolling or other fancy walking glitches
 - routing knows special map topology (e.g. Lost Hills)
The routeworthy spots nearest the mouse cursor will be highlighted: greenish if guaranteed to yield a location, yellowish (mixed quest) if maybe empty.
You can turn off these routing and highlighting marks if you find them distracting (options menu).  Even if you turn off these generalized routing marks, 
you can still click on Link to get the temporary, specific routing marks on-demand.

Clicking the 'Hint decoder' button in the bottom right pops up the 'Aquamentus Awaits' table, where you can populate location hints for dungeons/swords. 
Each hinted-but-not-yet-found location causes a 'halo' to appear on the triforce/sword icon in the upper portion of the tracker, and hovering the halo
shows the possible locations for that dungeon or sword cave.  Hint-halo-highlights on the overworld map will be colored:
  green:   if it's a location you can uncover with your current inventory, and is guaranteed to yield a location
  yellow:  if it's a location you can uncover with your current inventory, but is not guaranteed to yield a location (mixed quest)
  red:     if it's a location you can't uncover yet (e.g. a push-block spot when you don't yet have the power bracelet)

"Item progress" bar lights up items as you get them or upgrade them, as a quick display summary of the player state.

You can click the 'Start Spot' icon in the legend to mark your starting screen on the overworld map.


TIMELINE

The timeline is an affordance, for e.g. viewers who watch a stream and arrive late, or for the player who finishes a seed and wants a retrospective of their game.
Every minute, the player's inventory (as captured in the top portion of the tracker) is read, and new items are posted to the timeline above the minute-marker.  
This makes it easy to look back and see e.g. that you got the wood sword in the 12th minute.

The timeline is non-interactive, it is just a display for capturing progress-over-time.


OPTIONS MENU

Above the timeline, there is a button labeled "Options..."  
Clicking this button causes the timeline pane to be replaced by the options menu.  
A variety of tracker features can be turned on and off here; mouse-hover the text for a detailed description.
Some randomizer flag settings are also featured here, notably 'Second quest dungeons' and 'Mirror overworld'.
The options pane automatically saves & closes when you click outside the pane, revealing the timeline once again.
Options are saved automatically to a JSON file, so that next time you use the tracker, it remembers your settings.


DUNGEON TRACKER

There are 9 tabs for the 9 dungeons.

The right column of each tab has an area with this dungeon's triforce and items, so you can edit them without having to mouse all the way to the top of the app.

Rooms can be marked as:
 - stairway transports 1-8, '?'
 - special room shapes (moats, chutes, tee, etc.)
 - special markers for certain rooms (digdogger+recorder; bow+arrow for gohma; gleeok+wand; blue bubble)
 - ad-hoc color markers (red/yellow/green) the player can use as they see fit (e.g. boss/triforce/bomb)
 - grey box (typical non-descript room)
The list of all these rooms appears in a popup.  In addition to scrolling, double-clicking a room will activate the popup.  
In the popup:
 - left-clicking a room selection darkens the room (especially the outline), intended to mark it 'complete' (e.g. floor drop (if any) has been gotten)
 - right-clicking marks it uncomplete (lighter), thus uncompleted rooms stand out brighter to the eye, reminding you what is left to do
Single-clicking an unmarked room transforms it into the default, non-descript room (dark or light, depending on left- or right- click).

You can 'circle' a room with a yellow dashed line by middle-clicking it (middle click again to toggle).  This is just an ad-hoc mark to make a room stand out.
(I often use this to mark rooms where I left a bomb pack drop to return to later; you can use however you like.)

If you click-and-drag with left mouse button, you can 'paint' a bunch of completed rooms by dragging over them.  
Same with right mouse button, but for uncompleted rooms.  
These features can be useful when you play part of a dungeon without mapping it, but then later decide you need to map it--quickly 'paint' what you have done.
Or if you enter a dungeon with a book-atlas-map, you might want to 'paint' the uncompleted dungeon rooms before starting.

Shift-clicking a room will black it out, as well as nearby doors; this is rarely useful except for Shapes 9 with a map, to immediately mark off the 'holes'.

Doors between rooms have three states:
 - dark grey is unknown (default)
 - green (left click) is "can go" (used for all kinds of doors/shutters/bombholes/etc)
 - red (right click) is "cannot go" (e.g. unbombable wall)

Sometimes you may mark up a bit of dungeon map, before noticing that (a portion of) your mapping is offset by a column.  You can click 'GRAB' in the corner 
of the dungeon map to switch to 'grab mode', which allows you to pick up entire segments of dungeon rooms and doors and move them at once (cut & paste) to 
fix an offset map.

Non-hidden dungeon numbers: FQ and SQ checkboxes will show First Quest or Second Quest outlines for that dungeon number.
Hidden dungeon numbers: 'FQ/SQ' button pops up all the vanilla dungeon shape outlines for you to choose from, with hover previews and hinting which ones 
    are compatible with your current room markup.

Dungeon tracking has no semantic meaning to the tracker, and can be used by the player however they see fit.

When your mouse is inside the dungeon map area, the location of that dungeon will be highlighted on the overworld map.


BLOCKERS

This is an area you can optionally use to mark 'dungeon blockers', for scenarios where you cannot complete a dungeon now and need to return later.
You can mark up to 2 blockers per dungeon.  The icons have these suggested meanings:
 - Sword:       you need better combat gear (sword upgrade, ring upgrade, or maybe wand)
 - Bow & Arrow: you need a bow and arrow (Gohma block, or maybe tons of Pols Voice)
 - Recorder:    you are blocked by Digdogger
 - Ladder:      there's a ladder block (moat)
 - Bait:        there's a hungry Goriya blocking you
 - Key:         you need more keys
 - Bomb:        you need to find more explosion walls
The list of all these icons appears in a popup.  In addition to scrolling, clicking a blocker box will activate the popup.  

When possible, the tracker will give a reminder when you may be unblocked, for example, if you marked 5 with a ladder block, then when you obtain the ladder:
    (WPF Only)  voice reminder:   "Now that you have the ladder, consider dungeon 5" 
                visual reminder:  (ladder icon) (right-arrow) (dungeon 5 icon)
You can toggle whether you get these reminders in the Options Menu.


NOTES

This area is for ad-hoc text note-taking by the player (e.g. quickly type "5 BU 128" to remind you to return to level 5 to buy a Bomb Upgrade for 128 rupees).
Unlike scrap paper on your desk, these notes are visible to stream viewers.


HOTKEYS

There is no support for hotkeys yet; this feature is on the to-do list.


SAVE STATE

There is no support for saving in-progress game data; the tool is currently designed only for playing a single continuous session.


BROADCAST WINDOW (WPF only) - experimental feature

On the options menu, you can opt into a 'broadcast window'.  This causes a separate, smaller window to appear; the new window is designed for stream-capture, 
for streamers who think the Z-Tracker app is too large for their stream layout.  The broadcast window has two possible displays: one is overworld-focused, and
the other is dungeon-map focused.  The broadcast window will automatically switch between views depending upon if your mouse is in the upper portion or the 
lower portion of the main Z-Tracker window.  The broadcast window is not interactive - it does not respond to mouse clicks, and is only a display.  Thus, you 
use the main Z-Tracker window exactly as your normally would, but rather than have your stream capture the main interactive Z-Tracker window, you instead 
capture the smaller broadcast window, and it will automatically show the correct subset of the view to your viewers, based on your mousing.

The broadcast window also has an option to be 2/3 size (512 pixels wide, rather than 768 pixels wide).


SPEECH SYNTHESIS (WPF only)

There are a variety of spoken reminders triggered based on the player's inventory, map progress, and time.  They are rather ad-hoc, stuff that helped Brian.
You can toggle various categories of voice reminders in the Options menu.

Visual icons representing these spoken reminders appear in the upper right corner of the timeline, both on Windows and on Linux.
You can toggle various categories of visual reminders in the Options menu.


SPEECH RECOGNITION (WPF only)

When hovering over a blank overworld map tile, with a microphone equipped, you can speak aloud e.g. "tracker set bomb shop" to mark the current tile as a bomb shop.

This option must be enabled when first starting the tracker on the startup screen, it cannot be enabled later while the application is running.

The list of recognized phrases is below (code from WPFUI.fs).  You can speak a second shop item phrase to set a second item of a shop.
If 'Hide Dungeon Numbers' is enabled, just say "tracker set level" to select the next free dungeon letter A-H; "tracker set level nine" still works.
