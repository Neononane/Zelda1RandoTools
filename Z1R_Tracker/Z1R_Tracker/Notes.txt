Notes about overall UI & behavior


F5 - place 'start screen' icon at moused tile
F10 - reset timer to 0


DUNGEON ITEM AREA

click to toggle having triforce (triforce numeral lights up white if location known on overworld map)
scroll to change item in a dungeon
click to toggle whether have that dungeon item (red box = no, green box = yes)

Most item progress has semantic meaning to the tracker with regards to routing/reminders/etc as described below.


OTHER ITEM AREA

coast item, armos item, white sword item - just like dungeon item boxes
4 take-any hearts - click or scroll to say you took a heart container (red heart) or chose another option (X)
wood sword, blue ring, wood arrow, blue candle, magic sword - click these when you get them, so they appear on the Timeline (see below)
bombs - click when you get bombs, to have map routing send you to bombable locations (see below)
boomstick book - click when you get, to mark timeline, and click S/B to toggle whether Shield or Book is available as a dungeon item
ganon/zelda - click when you kill ganon or rescue zelda, to mark the timeline; clicking zelda will also post your finish time as text in the NOTES section
(timer, current hearts - just for display)
OW spots left checkbox - highlight all remaining gettable overworld map tiles

(WPF only)
Audio reminders - toggle all speech synthesis on/off ; recorder/bracelet - toggle just reminders remaining overworld spots requiring those items


OVERWORLD MAP

HFQ/HSQ - if flagsset not known to be 1st/2nd/mixed overworld, select mixed at start, and you Hide First Quest or Hide Second Quest if that's later helpful
Show zones - click or hover to show overworld map zones, as hinted by randomizer NPCs for locations
Show coords - click or hover to show a coordinate overlay
16x8 Map Tiles - scroll to mark what is there:
 - 1-9 dungeons
 - 1-4 any roads (stair warps)
 - S3/S2 magical sword/white sword item cave
 - ??? hint shop
 - (items) item shop
 - heart/potion "take any one you want" cave
 - potions potion shop
 - ?rupee free money or gambling
 - X nothing, or don't care
Left clicking an unmarked map tile will mark it 'X'
Left or right clicking an item shop will cycle through choices of a second item in the shop (max 2 items)
Mouse-hover for routing from the current tile:
 - a path will be drawn from the currently mouse location to all "routeworthy" locations, e.g.
    - unmarked overworld spots
    - uncompleted dungeons
    - un-gotten coast item, white sword item, magical sword
 - "routeworthiness" takes into account your current items (e.g. will not route to burnable tree if have no candle)
 - routing takes into account your current items (e.g. will not cross river if have no ladder)
 - routing understands any-road warps
 - routing assumes recorder takes you to dungeons you already have gotten the triforce from (a common randomizer flag)
 - routing assumes no screen-scrolling or other fancy walk glitches
 - routing knows special map topology (e.g. Lost Hills)
The 8-ish routeworthy spots nearest the mouse cursor will be highlighted yellowish.
(WPF only) Right clicking arrow/boomstickbook/bluering/bluecandle in upper right UI will cause routing to only send you to shops containing that item for the next 10s.

"Item progress" bar lights up items as you get them or upgrade them, as kind of a quick summary of the player state


TIMELINE

The timeline is an affordance, for e.g. viewers who watch a stream and arrive late, or for the player who finishes a seed and wants a retrospective of their game.
Once per minute, the player's inventory (as captured in the top portion of the tracker) is read, and new items are posted to the timeline, above or below the minute-marker,
and if a heart was gained, a heart is posted directly on the timeline.  This makes it easy to see e.g. that you got the wood sword in the 12th minute.

The timeline is non-interactive, it is just a display capturing progress-over-time.


DUNGEON TRACKER

There are 9 tabs for the 9 dungeons.

Rooms can be scrolled to mark:
 - stairway transports 1-9
 - special room shapes (horizontal/vertical chute, tee)
 - ad-hoc markers (red/yellow/green) the player can use as they see fit
 - grey box (typical 'uncompleted room')
Clicking a room darkens the room (especially the outline), intended to mark it 'complete' (floor drop (if any) has been gotten). Thus uncompleted rooms stand out brighter.
If you click and drag with left mouse button, you can 'paint' a bunch of completed rooms by dragging over them.  Same with right mouse button, but for uncompleted rooms.
Shift-clicking a room will black it out, as well as nearby doors, useful for e.g. Shapes 9 when you have the map, to immediately mark off the 'holes'.

Doors between rooms have three states:
 - dark grey is unknown (default)
 - green (left click) is "can go" (used for all kinds of doors/shutters/bombholes/etc)
 - red (right click) is "cannot go" (e.g. unbombable wall)

FQ and SQ checkboxes will show First Quest or Second Quest outlines for that dungeon number.

Dungeon tracking has no semantic meaning to the tracker, and can be used by the player however they see fit.


NOTES

This area is for ad-hoc textual note-taking by the player (e.g. "2 gohma" to remind you to return to dungeon 2 when you have bow&arrow)


SPEECH SYNTHESIS (WPF only)

There are a variety of spoken reminders triggered based on the player's inventory, map progress, and time.  They are rather ad-hoc, stuff that helped Brian.
You can turn them off with the Audio reminders checkbox in the upper right.


SPEECH RECOGNITION (WPF only)

When hovering over a blank map tile, with a microphone equipped, you can speak e.g. "tracker set bomb shop" to mark the current tile as a bomb shop.

The list of recognized phrases is below (code from WPFUI.fs).  You can speak a second shop item phrase to set a second item of a shop.

let wakePhrase = "tracker set"
let mapStatePhrases = [|
        "any road"
        "sword three"
        "sword two"
        "hint shop"
        "arrow shop"
        "bomb shop"
        "book shop"
        "candle shop"
        "blue ring shop"
        "meat shop"
        "key shop"
        "take any"
        "potion shop"
        "money"
        |]
