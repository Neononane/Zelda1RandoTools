Just a place to dump feature ideas (small or big) or fixes/improvements


(Don't forget to keep Notes.txt up-to-date as change features!)

(dungeon palette rom)

test PTT, 'level one', TAG reminders


SMALL

consider controller-button push-to-talk to explicitly activate speech recognition, to compensate for streaming-speech accuracy
 - option to play a sound when voice makes a mark
 - maybe want a quick 'unmark' gesture, to undo accidents?
 - if ship PTT feature, need a gamepad button chooser binding thingy, even if e.g. ask them to go to gamepad-tester.com and then select a number 0-9

select item box via voice?  select dungeon room via voice?

(Kigalas wants dungeon door options.  Keep in mind e.g. zhelper lets you filter out items you don't want to scroll thru, so i could also have options for 'extra UI' some people might opt out of)

timer: maybe two right clicks to reset (rather than F10), or a 0:00 button that takes two clicks? or a shift-click?

always-bombable spots:  
 - I guess I could overlay a grey question mark icon over the maybe rooms? Like the inverse of the 'X' rooms with a '?'  - no it looks awful
 - or make the 'highlight pixel' a darker color?


shift-click the start screen to place the lime circle? 
something better than F5 for start icon? drag-drop maybe, explained on startup screen? click legend, then click map? hm.  (Keep as is, but add hover tooltip in legend?)

announce known coast/WS item name ('get the white sword off the coast with the ladder'/'consider the white sword item, which is a heart container')

power bracelet spots with red box, like whistle spots have blue?
decide if right-click bomb/candle/book/ring WPF feature is worth keeping, or needs UI feedback, or port to Avalonia, or what to do
binary packaging for redistribution?
versioning . . .
ad-hoc counters? e.g. for door repair charges, or whatever else folks may want to track
yellow door state? (maybe left/right rotate forward/reverse thru unknown->green->yellow->red cycle)
show list of remaining box items? if less than N left?

(start screen eventually have 3. start OR load old data)

MEDIUM

I've been thinking I might want something along the lines of "highlight most recent map tile change" or "long duration mouse trail" or something.  
Like I have found that, I might be mapping stuff, and then go mark an item box or whatever, and then be like, 'wait, where am I? where should the mouse be?'  
Or I may find a dungeon, and select its dungeon map tab but forget to mark its location on the overworld, and then later be in the dungeon and be like 'where am I?'  
So I wonder if there is some good heuristic I can apply that is like, based on your mouse movements over the past few minutes, 
I think the most likely spot you are on the overworld is here (highlighted).
I think the heuristic is something like, there is a YouAreHere (x,y) and marking a map tile pokes it, or hovering a map square for at least ten seconds pokes it.  
Maybe?  An unfortunate interaction is that I sometimes move my mouse to an 'X'ed tile just to ensure that my speech doesn't accidentally mark the map 
(speech only affects unmarked tiles), so that confounds it a little.

"when X remind Y" (can imagine various system with note text parsing; dragging e.g. 1 and ladder icons into notes to say 1 is ladder blocked; generic reminder when get bow+arrow; etc)
(possibly related to item above) way to take notes of e.g. dungeon ladder/gohma block, that is mouse-only for keyboardless folks
 - Make notes textbox smaller, and have 8 reminder areas where you can scroll
 - Sword – need better weapon; BowArrow – need bow; Recorder; ladder; Bomb; Key; Bait; money??? (bomb upgrade, but how much, hard to mouse)
 - Can auto hook a voice reminder when you get the unblocker
ui display could be dungeon number and icon boxes (how deal with scrolling? i guess not make a forceUpdate, so nothing happen until they interact with other ui)
   text  1:_ _ 2:_ _                text = BLOCKERS(hovertext explains) 
   3:_ _ 4:_ _ 5:_ _
   6:_ _ 7:_ _ 8:_ _
when you get the unblocker, numeral/box could get some highlight (and voice would announce once - accumulate all into one sentence "now that you have ladder, consider dungeons 2, 3, and 6")
when dungeon completed, could be grayed out
might you ever want to clear/change it? what if unmark getting unblocker (accidentally click bow, then unclick)?

General thoughts for LEVEL-?: For maybe marking unknown triforces A-H and assigning colors and labeling map with letters instead of numbers, maybe projecting colors like 
white sword item gets projected onto S2 tile.  A-H might not be good lettering, since it's associated with coordinates, maybe STUVWXYZZ or IJKLMNOP or something.

crawl text as alternative to speech synthesis reminder (for Avalonia and for WPF-alternative) - could maybe go in timeline area?

review other common flagsets from rando, what works, what could work, etc
 - currently assumes these rando flags:
    - (routing, map legend) whistle to new dungeons & not recorder-to-unbeaten
    - (reminders) change sword hearts
    - (reminders/display) 3 starting hearts
    - (reminders) level 9 requires 8 triforces
 - works poorly with
    - hide dungeon numbers

Layout/size/stretch options were common requests for zhelper – can I scale?

auto save/load tracker state (not just options)? no, would be better for explicit UI action to save to a filename, and load from start screen, zhelper behavior is confusing to folks

hotkeys (e.g. immediately mark S3)

BIG

layout options, e.g. maybe overworld map and dungeon/notes are two tabs, kinda like zhelper, for those who prefer a 4x3-ish layout, etc, hm
Keyboard focus, keyboard shortcuts for marking maps, etc
auto-tracking (link to emulator)







comparisons to ZHelper

ZHelper has lots of features this tracker lacks (save state, network coordination, support for more rando flagsets, ...) and consumes less screen real estate.

That said, I think this tracker has a number of advantages in usability, both in design and feature set:

 - All the items from a dungeon are in a single column.  No more accidentally marking 6's basement item in 5's slot, and then being confused later.

 - More consistent use of color: as things are completed (overworld 'X' spot, completed dungeon/room), they get 'dimmer' coloration, to fade somewhat into the background.
   As a result, the eye is drawn to the bright spots, which are where the remaining work is and where the player needs to focus.

 - Less scrolling: when an item or dungeon location is found, it gets removed from the 'scroll wheel pool', which means that as the game progresses, you need fewer scrolls to find the remaining mark you need.

 - Overworld zoom magnifier: no more squinting at the tracker to see exactly where the bomb-hole is located on that one screen.

 - Fewer clicks: mouse hovering can show the area zone overlay or helpful hints; fewer default options for e.g. dungeon doors provide a simpler interface.

 - Quick after-the-fact dungeon markup: if you play half a dungeon without mapping, and then decide you need to map it, drag gestures can quickly 'paint out' the already-explored portions.

This tracker also has a number of attractive added features, including:

 - ability to mark two items in a shop, rather than just one

 - ability to correct mistakes in dungeon markup (e.g. when you put a bunch of rooms in the wrong column) by cut&pasting a segment

 - a note-taking text area to type ad-hoc reminders to yourself (e.g. "2 gohma", or "L5 bomb upgrade 106")

 - overworld routing guidance that can help steer newer players to remaining unexplored locations

 - a timeline which displays the 'history' of when you got key items, to orient latecomer stream viewers, or to help you replay the seed in your head in the post-game recap analysis

 - speech synthesis features for voice reminders, and speech recognition features for marking bits of the overworld with no scrolling
