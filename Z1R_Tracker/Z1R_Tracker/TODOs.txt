TODOs


Just a place to dump feature ideas (small or big) or fixes/improvements


(Don't forget to keep Notes.txt up-to-date as change features!)


SMALL

speech recognition: remove wait time after just moused, consider extra accuracy for second-shop item?
decide if right-click bomb/candle/book/ring WPF feature is worth keeping, or needs UI feedback, or port to Avalonia, or what to do
binary packaging for redistribution (can probably compile all resources into a single EXE)
second quest dungeons (4 rather than 1 has 3 items)

MEDIUM

timeline possible redesigns: 1.5h per line, or maybe adaptive to fit UI.  also maybe not icons both above & below, but only above... other ways to better use space...
"shift a portion of dungeon marks one cell left" because you oopsed the initial column.  Easy concept, tough to implement robustly and perhaps tough to find good UI gesture to activate.
"when X remind Y" (can imagine various system with note text parsing; dragging e.g. 1 and ladder icons into notes to say 1 is ladder blocked; generic reminder when get bow+arrow; etc)
(possibly related to item above) way to take notes of e.g. dungeon ladder/gohma block, that is mouse-only for keyboardless folks
crawl text as alternative to speech synthesis reminder (for Avalonia and for WPF-alternative)
consider controller-button push-to-talk to explicitly activate speech recognition, to compensate for streaming-speech accuracy

BIG

layout options, e.g. maybe overworld map and dungeon/notes are two tabs, kinda like zhelper, for those who prefer a 4x3-ish layout, etc, hm
Keyboard focus, keyboard shortcuts for marking maps, etc
auto-tracking (link to emulator)
