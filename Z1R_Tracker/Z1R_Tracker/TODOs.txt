TODOs

Just a place to dump feature ideas (small or big) or fixes/improvements

(Don't forget to keep Notes.txt up-to-date as change features!)


CURRENT PRIORITIES

update docs with changes

make a decision about linux (and update docs)

add a 'whats new in 1.1' section to docs
 - starting/extra items
 - maybe-blockers
 - BOARD v LEVEL
 - (legend on overworld magnifier)
 - (current dungeon tab highlights corresponding blockers area)
 - (dungeon door/room mouseover feedback)
 - (show hotkeys window remembers size/location)



put logo icon in the app somewhere

some kind of 'dungeon overview' - which have maps/tri/etc... like blockers, a metadata overview
dungeon summary tab (see marc convo)

consider in HDN making known numbers appear on overworld map e.g. "A5" like a two-item shop

cd wants ganon & zelda rooms

Kigalas: Had an idea last night - mouse hover over any of the 4 hearts to highlight Potion shops on the map (me: expectation might be to highlight un-taken take-anys, hm)

hovering legend - recorder dest, dungeon, any road should highlight those on map

add tooltips on all hoverables (or a status bar, or something)

kigalas: grab (when click dungeon tab then press enter)

kig: Can we have a .txt file to use as a base to pull from for the Notes section like Hotkeys has?

in HDN, i always forget 8 (or 1) has 3 items, some kind of 'dungeon is not yet complete' voice reminder? ("recall that dungeon N has a third item")
 - second quest, 1 v 4?

2Q ow, vanilla 5 is a fairy fountain, should mark as such

add a good screenshot to front page github (link from in-app version button), above 'motivation' section

HFQ/HSQ maybe should change from jailbars to full-tile slate-greying?  Need to actually test this feature sometime, even if by running 2Q but selecting mixed intentionally.
 - maybe reincarnate this feature as a routing-rectangles filter, e.g. mid-game you set the 'only route me to 1Q rooms' or something? hmm







Maybe like a subscript on the item-progress bar on e.g. the recorder saying how many more recorder spots there are unmarked?

Make  documentation picture of all the hover-targets and what they do

homer wants the 'highlight empty box' - i have a discord conversation with a full design

homer wants door-inference (think about)
 - if you just marked a new room, AND the new room is adjacent to only one existing room, AND the new-room-mark is not a transport stair, then draw a green door between the new room and the only-adjacent-room.
 - off-by-default option ('infer some dungeon doors based on rooms')

homer: i will noodle on that to, for hotkey folks, right click is useless and wasted, maybe consider scroll to bring up popup and use right click other way

bogie: could add like hotkey mappings for rooms that affect adjacent doors, so hovering a room could have hotkeys for the room, (and drops, and bosses), and also adjacent doors

homer probably could use bomb-default-on and big-icons-default-on (he even wants candle)

"now that you have the any key, consider dungeon 8" could be silenced if any key was marked gotten in 8

the bottom 'item progress' is a good summary, though grayed-out silvers and have-bluish-silvers look very similar; hm, i could do a background thingy there maybe

Make screenshots of broadcast mode mid-game in OW/dungroom popups for the front page github

the rando spoiler log does not mirror coordinates, so D5 is death armos normally, but not in mirrored, so I need to change how 'coords' displays in mirrored, ugh

HDN, non-shapes, in addition to red-green room match, maybe could yellow out numbers already taken? hmmm

possibly an 'any road' single hotkey that works like voice, and auto-selects next road?

consider adding my 'dungeon drops' room table somewhere somehow

make old man in dungeon be toggle, for unread unbook hints, if want to return to hints post-book

Tracker could be smart about https://discord.com/channels/368763663986982912/586261700064575488/882743164216152084
 - only works if tracking everything and not nothing/dnc-ing other spots, or if only consider 'other' marks as 'true', can floor/ceiling possible %
 - Yellow percentage, count DRCs, etc
 - could at least infer e.g. that yellow turns red when num greens remain = num remaining spots 

consider kigalas feedback:
Also, when you select Second Quest Dungeons can you have it automatically have the checkbox for SQ clicked?
Broadcast window seems to retain its position after closing but the main window doesn't. Can that be a thing for the tracker itself?

tip: you can't have both an item appear when the enemies die and a push block stair, unless the stairs are already visible
 - actually Standing Item:  Can only have a push block if RMO is on or 2nd quest is the Dungeon setup.
    [7:57 PM] FurySK: Drop item: Cannot ever have a push block across all functions, outside of diamond staircases (edited)





distributing version process
 - for a full release, change the version number in OverworldData.fs (e.g. v1.0.0)
 - edit Notes.txt to point to upcoming branch URL
 - commit to master
 - make a branch e.g. "v1.0" in git which is a spur for the release (and bugfix updates to app/docs)
 - make a tag on the branch with the full version number e.g. "v1.0.0"
 - commit the branch
ABOVE IS DONE
 - delete entire Relase directory
     - get rid of hotkeys/settings/crash log
 - run the program once
     - creates hotkeys/settings/crash log/ZTracker.lnk
 - delete ZTracker.lnk (has my machine's paths hardcoded)
 - zip up directory
 - publish Release in the branch on the tag, and add the zip as a resource
then users can
 - unzip folder somewhere
 - run Z1R_WPF.exe
 - that will start the program. it will also create a ZTracker.lnk shortcut in the folder, which you can copy wherever you like (e.g. place on desktop)

SMALL

possibly a reminder when all dungeons have been found _or_hinted_, so you don't look everywhere when you have a hint? hm

clicking the kitty should meow or purr or something


imagine adding a status bar that has info like 'has burn bush' or 'has recorder spot' to explain/reinforce the meanings of the pixel colors, and 
could also be a place to add text for LostWoods/LostHills tiles.  Not sure where to place it in the UI yet, though...
  - advanced: status bar could show % chance of a yellow highlight yielding a location

Consider dungeon-door scrollwheel to popup more options (would require figuring out what other states are useful, and finding decent art for them)


consider other color for FQ/SQ border outlines (red too akin to your wall marks) purple?


consider hover-feedback-of-all-clickables (e.g. triforce could slightly-darken-color-on-hover)


hotkeys
 - consider if Foo_Nothing=x, and you press 'x' to unmark, if maybe 'x' again will 'restore what was just unmarked', like a single-undo
 - any consideration of spacebar or capital-letter-distiguishing?


dungeon room ui:
imagine if could add blue wiz or blue darknut or blue lanmo decoration
(how easy is it to 'undo' an accidental room mark, bring back to 'unmarked'?  clear all marks versus clear the room type?)
which rooms visually pop? uncompleted and left-floor-drop-behind?
consider also eventual replay-the-seed scenarios (if/when i have save/reload functionality)


homer:
 - in sprite shuffle, might want to mark 2 white sword caves because cant tell
        - sprite shuffle, see 'something' off coast, might mark wand, but actually white sword, choicedomain makes a little tricky
 - homer found A, then 9, then went into A, mapped inside 9, made a mess, hm (first mark has audio feedback?)

lorgon: this is one reason i wonder if, like 'start spot', extra overworld marks may be useful
lorgon: mark screens with bomb droppers
lorgon: like imagine middle click from dungeons
like 'start spot', could have other overworld decorations (e.g. to mark bomb droppers?)


start spot hotkey?


'paint' all the rooms you have 'listened' in 9 for ganon? (assuming been-in = listened, boss screams confound)
 - if people paint out the map, it's useless. could use 'completed' rooms only, but then kinda violates 'no semantics' on dung rooms
 - related: where can zelda fit (some explicit mark for shutter doors?)
 - gesture could be hover-ganon and hover-zelda, and there is room to bring those icons down into inset, i think


possible reminder: 'there is only 1 remaining location that XXX can be, hover its hint-halo to see it'
possible reminder: if bow/silvers/ladder are marked red on tracker for more than N minutes, remind they exist in tracker box XXX

marc note about bow dungeon room and bow blocker via dungeon-mouse-location-context - imagine if Blocker_Bow was listened for in dungeon area after rooms and hooked to next free blocker box
 - kigalas also suggested auto-blocker-ing based on dungeon markup, and I explained my misgivings
marc: Binding request for 2.x to get it noted: switch dungeon tab, e.g. [Ctrl+2] -> switch to dungeon 2

if you get a 'meet' hint about white/magic sword cave location, could/should there be an accelerator? same for hint shop (long mouse moves)
  - for hint shop, there could be a special right-click action which accelerates into the hint decoder popup and warps back on complete
        - could make populateOverworldAcceratorTable() method to pass in some values more easily maybe
    ah, but hint shop already has a right click action, which is bright->dark toggle, and is 'needed' e.g. for sword cave hints or hint shops you bought out
    and you can't assume the user wants to mark a hint

mouse thumb button for rare thing, like mark all dungeon room doors as open or blocked? thumb button must be live-without-able

maybe make separate project for generation-tools, e.g.
 - make magnifier bmps offline, save to a resource file, then load resource
 - would also allow me to draw on the generated ones for e.g.
        draw arrows on LostHills/LostWoods, I almost got 'lost' in mirror overworld, but this should be good teaching tool, so the 'path' and alternative exit should be there somehow
         - maybe can draw it on magnifier?
        i saw homer count aloud '1234' and '12345' on the river spots to know where to bomb, magnifier could display even more help, on certain screens?
         - river, NW corner, south bomb coast, mid-candle-row, any others?




hide dungeon numbers:
 - auto-fill-in last number, or other inferences?!?  I think no, maybe voice-reminder-suggestion is better.  Player should 'own' tracker marks, it should only suggest?
        - or it could be another popup, highlight final number, say it must be N by process of elimination, player can confirm or cancel?
 - irrecoverable error can occur when startup in non-hidden-dungeons mode, mark some map, and it's hidden dungeons, hmm (eventually, save/load state might help)
 - i had a hint that D3 was by a lake, and found a dungeon by a lake, can I auto-infer it is D3 sometimes?
 - hints are generally much harder to use, might be opportunities to have tracker be smart and help 
      - gleeok lurks with the magic key: today, in non-HDN, I mark an un-got key in 4 manually - if can move this into hint decoder, then HDN can apply some logics (immediate or later)
        similar, even in non-HDN: Right now hint decoder for white sword location halo, and top UI for white sword item mark, nice if both in one place (when get hint of item & location)
 - I am not sure if 'can put same number on multiple dungeons' is a bug or feature yet


I can't capture some hints e.g. ""play a melody to obtain the white sword"" - if i could record that hint, maybe i can deduce stuff





my modal elements violate MouseEnter/MouseLeave parity, so e.g.,
 - mouse into dungeon 3 map, L3 is showLocator highlighted on overworld
 - invoke room popup
 - move mouse into overworld map, click to dismiss popup
 - L3 is still showLocator()ed because dungeon map never got a MouseLeave event
I could not worry about that, or apply some ad-hoc fixes for the common case, but in general it seems non-trivial


maybe have an optionsMenu thing for all the showLocator stuff, in case folks find it distracting?

consider controller-button push-to-talk to explicitly activate speech recognition, to compensate for streaming-speech accuracy
 - option to play a sound when voice makes a mark
 - maybe want a quick 'unmark' gesture, to undo accidents?
 - if ship PTT feature, need a gamepad button chooser binding thingy, even if e.g. ask them to go to gamepad-tester.com and then select a number 0-9
     - and probably also want keyboard bind like left shift, if can figure out

Speech recogn – can multiple be running at once? Different grammars, context based on mouse location/popups etc
select item box via voice?  select dungeon room via voice?

other possible hotkey stuff?  (start/stop timer, got mags, ... ?)  other possible keys (shift/ctrl, thumb button, gamepad, remap left/right click in various contexts, ...?)

ad-hoc counters? e.g. for whatever folks may want to track? hotkey'd?

broadcast window doesnt capture drag-drop mouse movement


MEDIUM

timeline & mistakes
 - ""The timeline is non-interactive, it is just a display for capturing progress-over-time.""
   Should it be possible to click (right-click?) a timeline item to remove it from the timeline to correct misclicks?
   This (as a way to remove an erroneously posted item and its timestamp), coupled with changing-item-box-content-after-post being reflected on the timeline, would address it?

timeline minute ticker maybe should only tick every 2 mins in 2nd hour, if only posting items every 2nd minute?
 - right now the item can be placed 'ahead' in the next minute of the minute marker, which people (even me) find weird
 - i think boxes now have Changed events, maybe the right thing to do is to re-architect the timeline to be 'true to tracker now'
   rather than 'snapshot'? means you can correct errors, but also means that you may lose history when correcting...

homer: larger shop icons (advanced users wont care as much about obscuring map)


[11:39 AM] Lorgon111: I am already starting to imagine a first-time-experience UI, along the lines of
ZTracker did not find a settings file on disk, perhaps this is your first time using this tool?
 - Yes, I am relatively new to Z1R and ZTracker, start me with basic default settings
 - Yes, I am a seasoned Z1R runner who has experience with other trackers, turn off the tutorial/helper options and quickly walk me through icons/customization/hotkeys
 - I know ZTracker, first time on this machine, give me some defaults and I can customize it myself
 - No, what, I just used this yesterday, help me troubleshoot why my settings did not get saved
[11:45 AM] marcmagus:
 - I know ZTracker, first time on this machine, give me some defaults and I can customize it myself
Multiple presets here? Something like 'new', 'speed-hotkey', 'helper-voice'?
[11:46 AM] marcmagus: (If config-editing is a thing, can also be done by shipping a few 'example' configs)
[11:46 AM] Lorgon111: yeah shipped samples is what I vaguely imagine

BIG

'undo'
[9:52 AM] homerjsmash: Yeah I like where you're going with all of this. Also this prompted another thought for me, one of my big mistakes I make is I accidentally reclick a tile I 
have already assigned. Example the potion shop is an open cave which is next to pb spot or something. When I finally get pb I move the mouse to that spot but accidentally fat finger
the potion shop, which since I deselect everything but x makes it an X. Shoot. What the heck was that cave? There's no undo button or something like that
[9:55 AM] Lorgon111: yes, undo, i have been vaguely thinking of that (mostly for speech recognition fat-AI-ing what you spoke), its a pain to code, but yes
like, not even just coding, but from a design perspective, someone scrolls down 3 slots on B4 and then realizes they meant to change B5, what should 'undo' do? undo one 
scroll? undo all recent (how recent?) changes to tile?  what will the user expect? etc etc etc it's a very difficult design space

Keyboard focus and control







comparisons to ZHelper

ZHelper has lots of features this tracker lacks (save state, network co-op coordination, custom icons, ...) and uses less screen real estate.

That said, I think this tracker has a number of advantages in usability, both in design and feature set:

 - All the items from a dungeon are in a single column.  No more accidentally marking 6's basement item in 5's slot, and then being confused later.

 - More consistent use of color: as things are completed (overworld 'X' spot, completed dungeon/room), they get 'dimmer' coloration, to fade somewhat into the background.
   As a result, the eye is drawn to the bright spots, which are where the remaining work is and where the player needs to focus.

 - Less scrolling & mousing: 
     - you can populate most icon boxes without any scrolling due to local popup menu showing all the item choices
     - you can populate most overworld tiles without any scrolling via speech recognition
     - local item popups and accelerators mean you rarely ever need to move the mouse to the top portion of the tracker

 - Overworld zoom magnifier: no more squinting at the tracker to see exactly where the bomb-hole is located on that one screen.

 - More information in fewer clicks: mouse hovering can show the area zone overlay, helpful hint locations, dungeon locations, and all kinds of other contextual information, with no switching tabs.

 - Quick after-the-fact dungeon markup: if you play half a dungeon without mapping, and then decide you need to map it, drag gestures can quickly 'paint out' the already-explored portions.
   Or if you have a book-atlas, you can 'paint out' the dungeon map of uncompleted rooms before starting it.

This tracker also has a number of attractive added features, including:

 - ability to mark two items in a shop, rather than just one

 - ability to correct mistakes in dungeon markup (e.g. when you put a bunch of rooms in the wrong column) by cut&pasting a segment

 - full support for 'hide dungeon numbers' flag - no more needing to move all your marks from one column to another after discovering you guessed the dungeon number wrong

 - a note-taking text area to type ad-hoc reminders to yourself (e.g. "L5 bomb upgrade 106"), and an area to mark dungeon blockers via icons (e.g. 4 needs ladder, 7 needs bow&arrow)

 - overworld routing guidance that can help steer newer players to remaining unexplored locations, or find the best route from A to B

 - a timeline which displays the 'history' of when you got key items, to orient latecomer stream viewers, or to help you replay the seed in your head in the post-game recap analysis

 - a sophisticated system for offering timely, useful reminders, via speech synthesis (voice reminders) and/or icon popups
 
 - speech recognition features for marking bits of the overworld without any scrolling or clicking

 - richer dungeon mapping: ability to mark each dungeon room as 'cleared' or not, independent of the room icon; also, ability to 'circle' rooms in dungeons
