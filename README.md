# Zelda1RandoTools

### A tracker for Zelda 1 Randomizer

This is a tracking tool for those who casually stream gameplay of seeds of fcouglin's [Zelda 1 Randomizer](https://sites.google.com/site/zeldarandomizer/).

This tool is inspired by [ZHelper](http://questwizard.net/zhelper/), a tool commonly used by z1r racers.

I wanted to create my own tool that I thought was better suited to certain audiences:

* For **seed runners**: provide a tracking tool with the best visual UI for communicating the relevant information to the player, and the simplest set of gestures for setting data in the UI. 
  This way the player can focus on playing the game, rather than fiddling with the tool to set data, or squinting at the tool to find what they need.

* For **stream viewers**: provide a tracker that immediately communicates the current state of the progress of the run, but also gives a sense of 'how the player got there'. The summary of
  'absolute progress' is always on-screen, as well as a historical timeline that shows when various items were first obtained during the run.  Someone who arrives in the middle of the stream should
  be able to immediately orient themselves via the on-screen tracking info.

* For **those learning z1r**: provide some helpful assistance and steering that makes it easier for the new player to decide what to do next.  Some features help route a path through the overworld 
  to find all of the necessary locations, and others provide reminder feedback about item progress and places that ought to be returned to, to finish the seed.

The final bullet (automated 'assistance') presumably makes the tool not 'race legal', and so **z1r racers** are not currently part of the target audience for this tool.  (In the future, I can imagine
having options to turn off some assistive features, but as someone who's not currently a member of the active racing community, I'm not even sure what the legal subset would be.  It's possible future
work on this project.)

### Features

You can get a sense of the features of the tracker by reading through [Notes.txt](/Z1R_Tracker/Z1R_Tracker/Notes.txt) and by looking at an
