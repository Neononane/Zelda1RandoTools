# Downloading and Installing Z-Tracker

Z-Tracker 1.2 is available for Windows.  (For the prior full release, visit [v1.1](https://github.com/brianmcn/Zelda1RandoTools/blob/v1.1/doc/TOC.md).  For Linux, check out [v1.0](https://github.com/brianmcn/Zelda1RandoTools/blob/v1.0/doc/TOC.md).)

The app is released as a .zip file folder of the executable and all its helper files.  Download the .zip file, and then

 - unzip the folder somewhere (wherever you want to store this installation of Z-Tracker)
 - run Z1R_WPF.exe to start the program (if it is missing, see [Windows Defender](#defender) section below)
 - running it will also create a ZTracker.lnk shortcut in the folder, which you can optionally copy wherever you like (e.g. place the shortcut on your Desktop, for easy double-click startup in the future)

The current release for Windows is version 1.2.3, and currently can be downloaded here: https://github.com/brianmcn/Zelda1RandoTools/raw/v1.2/UserCustomAssets/ZTracker_v1.2.3.zip

### <a id="defender"></a> Windows Defender

Windows Defender is pretty aggressive about unknown .exe files, and sometimes flags Z1R_WPF.exe as a virus and quarantines the file (this can change from week to week).  
You might need to select 'Run Anyway' from a warning screen, or go into Window Defender's virus & threat protection history to 'Restore' the Z1R_WPF.exe if it gets quarantined.

Note: If Chrome prevents you from downloading the zip file, you can disable security temporarily:
- In the top-right corner of the browser window, click the three dots icon.
- Select "Settings" from the menu.
- Select "Privacy and security" on the left side of the page.
- In the section "Privacy and security", click "Security".
- Note what security protection level you are using.
- Select "No protection".
- Confirm the following pop-up with "Turn off".
- Download the ZTracker zip file.
- Repeat the first 4 steps to return to the security settings.
- Change back to your original security protection level you noted, to re-enable safe browsing.
