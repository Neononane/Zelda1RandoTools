# Downloading and Installing Z-Tracker

Z-Tracker 1.1 is available for Windows.  (For Linux, check out [v1.0](https://github.com/brianmcn/Zelda1RandoTools/blob/v1.0/doc/TOC.md).)

The app is released as a .zip file folder of the executable and all its helper files.  Download the .zip file, and then

 - unzip the folder somewhere (wherever you want to store this installation of Z-Tracker)
 - run Z1R_WPF.exe to start the program
 - running it will also create a ZTracker.lnk shortcut in the folder, which you can optionally copy wherever you like (e.g. place the shortcut on your Desktop, for easy double-click startup in the future)

TODO update

The current release for Windows is version 1.0.1, and currently can be downloaded only from the z1r discord server, in the 'Randomizer Tracker' section, as a recent message on the '#general' subchannel.  
Here's an invite link to the z1r discord: https://www.discord.me/z1randomizer

Windows Defender is pretty aggressive about unknown .exe files, and sometimes flags Z1R_WPF.exe as a virus and quarantines the file (this can change from week to week).  
You might need to select 'Run Anyway' from a warning screen, or go into Window Defender's virus & threat protection history to 'Restore' the Z1R_WPF.exe if it gets quarantined.
