# Stream-Capturing Z-Tracker with OBS

You should use OBS 'Window Capture' to capture the Z-Tracker window for streaming.  

For best results, set the 'Window Match Priority' to 'Window title must match'.

See also the [Broadcast Window section](extras.md#broadcast-window) for more capture and sizing options.
