# Quick Start Guide

Here's the bare minimum of what you need to know to use Z-Tracker.  If you prefer to watch a video, here's a link to a [short video tutorial on Z-Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IABAWaJCfRk).

On the initial screen, be sure to select startup options that correspond to your z1r rando flagset.

The main application window looks like this:

To mark that you got a **triforce**, click its icon to toggle the triforce in the **Dungeon Item Area**.

To mark that you got an **item** from a dungeon (or from White Sword Cave, Coast, or Armos), click an item box in the **Dungeon Item Area** (or Other Item Area) and follow the popup instructions.

When you first obtain an item such as a **sword, blue candle, or bombs**, click its icon in the **Other Item Area**.

On the **Overworld Map**, left click a tile to mark "Don't Care" spots, or right click a tile to select a marking from the popup, to mark spots of interest.

On the **Dungeon Tracker**:

 - select the **tab** that corresponds to the dungeon you are mapping
 - left click or right click **doors** to mark them green (can-go) or red (can't go)
 - the first room you click on will be marked as the dungeon entrance, left click to rotate the entrance arrow
 - left click other **rooms** to toggle them complete (dark outline) or uncomplete (bright outline)
 - right click a room to select other markings, such as transport staircases (follow the popup instructions)

**It is worth spending a couple minutes outside of gameplay to get familiar with the various popups and to learn the icons.**  For example, right-click an overworld tile, then hover each of the 
icons in the popup, to read the descriptions and learn the icons and meanings.  Do the same for a dungeon room, and for marking an item found in a dungeon.  In the overworld, also try
marking the white sword location, as well as a 'take any one you want' location, to see the associated popups.  The interface is designed to be speedy in gameplay, but you first need to 
familiarize yourself with how these bits work.

If you like keyboard control of the tracker, be sure to read the section on [HotKeys](extras.md#hotkeys).

Those are the essentials.  For more detail, read the [full documentation](TOC.md).
