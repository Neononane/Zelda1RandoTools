Here's the bare minimum of what you need to know to use Z-Tracker.

On the initial screen, be sure to select startup options that correspond to your z1r rando flagset.

The main application window looks like this:

To mark that you got a **triforce**, click its icon to toggle the triforce in the **Dungeon Item Area**.

To mark that you got an **item** from a dungeon (or from White Sword Cave, Coast, or Armos), click an item box in the **Dungeon Item Area** (or Other Item Area) and follow the popup instructions.

When you first obtain an item such as a **sword, blue candle, or bombs**, click its icon in the **Other Item Area**.

On the **Overworld Map**, left click a tile to mark "Don't Care" spots, or right click a tile to select a marking from the popup, to mark spots of interest.

On the **Dungeon Tracker**:

 - select the **tab** that corresponds to the dungeon you are mapping
 - left click or right click **doors** to mark them green (can-go) or red (can't go)
 - the first room you click on will be marked as the dungeon entrance, left click to rotate the entrance arrow
 - left click other **rooms** to toggle them complete (dark outline) or uncomplete (bright outline)
 - right click a room to select other markings, such as transport staircases (follow the popup instructions)

Those are the essentials.  For more detail, read the [full documentation](TOC.md).
